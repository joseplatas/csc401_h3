Hey man,

I've been having a hard time understanding, but I think I finally got it once I familiarized myself with HashMaps in Java.

I've uploaded 2 java files: Initialize.java and MapTest.java. MapTest is the driver that uses Initialize. Initialize will parse the data from the RTF file and put it into a
HashMap data structure.

I think it'd be useful to divide the RTF file into sections based on white space, so let's say that Section 1 is the first line that defines the amount of nodes/edges,
Section 2 is the respective node's X and Y coordinates, and Section 3 is the list of edges.

We need to do the following:
	-Create a LinkedList for each node's edges
	-Populate the LinkedList using Section 3
	-Figure out the weights of Section 2 and apply them to the LinkedList (the calculateWeights method is useful for this)

This will put us in a really good spot. I've copied the test RTF file as "testusa_map_data.rtf" that only inlcude 6 nodes rather than the crazy amount of the actual test file.

I'll see if I can work more on this tonight. The due date has been pushed back to Sunday, so we have time.

Ill be working on this tonight too.
Thanks for the follow up.
