# CSC 401 - Homework 3
Map routing program using Basic Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

<h3>Programming Description:</h3>

<p>
In this homework, we will implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. This algorithm is widely
used in geographic information systems (GIS) including MapQuest and GPS-based car navigation
systems.
</p>

All of the files are in the folder Java files.
The following program is using MapMain.java to compile the code from MapVertices.java
This files only begin to the search for the smallest path but it doesnt work.



The other two files are working files that jason was working on as well which seems to be working properly.
Since im not sure what he will be submitting right now.
Im submitting this to make sure we submit something as i do not have the latest version of the Repo.

Thank you.
